# Next Word Prediction Project

Next Word Prediction involves forecasting the most likely word or phrase that will come next in a sentence or piece of text. This functionality is similar to features found in applications like messaging apps, search engines, virtual assistants, and autocorrect tools on smartphones, where suggestions are provided as you type or speak.

## Project Overview

Next Word Prediction is a language modeling task in Machine Learning that aims to predict the most probable word or sequence of words that follows a given input context. This task leverages statistical patterns and linguistic structures to generate accurate predictions based on the context provided.

## How to Build a Next Word Prediction Model

To construct a Next Word Prediction model, follow these steps:

1. **Collect a Diverse Dataset**: Gather a variety of text documents to ensure the model learns from a rich and diverse vocabulary.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and tokenize the text data to prepare it for model training.
3. **Data Preparation**: Create input-output pairs where the input is a sequence of words and the output is the next word in the sequence.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Generate features such as word embeddings that capture the semantic meaning of words.
5. **Model Selection**: Choose an appropriate model, such as an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer).
6. **Model Training**: Train the model on your dataset while tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.
7. **Model Improvement**: Experiment with different techniques and architectures to enhance the model's accuracy and generalization.


## Additional Notes
The project consists of two distinct datasets and corresponding notebooks. One of the notebooks was developed independently, while the second notebook's methodology is largely inspired by an insightful article that provided valuable guidelines for model implementation : https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2023/07/17/next-word-prediction-model-using-python/
